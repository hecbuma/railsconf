RailsConf 2013 Schedule App
=====================

This a super simple responsive app to manage your RailsConf Schedule.

## Who it works?
We perform a [screen scraping](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/01/29/how-to-get-what-you-need-with-nokogiri.html) to [railsconf.com](http://railsconf.com) to get the schedule data, after that we build a JSON with that info and put it on a simple rails app with a nice front-end using [Gumby 2](http://gumbyframework.com/) 

### thanks to [Eduardo Figuerola](https://github.com/efigarolam/railsconf_schedule_to_json) for the Screen scraping.

### TODO
