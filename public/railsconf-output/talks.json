		"speaker": "Fletcher Nichol",
		"description": "In a world of public and private clouds, API-driven load balancers, and bare metal servers there has never been more choice when building your next scalable killer application. As the complexity of your application's deployment environment increases, the economics of automation start to pay off. In this session we'll discuss the challenges facing complex application deployments, strategies to make development environments mirror production, and how you can manage architectural changes with your application over time. Automate all the things? Let's find out!"

		"description": "The Ruby on Rails developer faces an interesting duality.  Their inner Rubyist is driven by a sense of beauty and explores a wide range of ways to solve a problem.  The inner Railser is driven by a strong set of conventions and is guided by the Rails Way™.  The /lib directory is where these developers meet and end result is a junk drawer of awkward code.In this talk, I go over a few ways to keep this junk drawer problem from happening by adding some conventions I've created from building Rails in anger:\n  * Treat /lib as a temple (keep /lib in a state to extract to a gem in minutes)\n  * Avoid autoloading everything in /lib \n  * Use configuration to hide credentials from your library code \n   * Isolate your Domain Objects from library concerns through DCI"

		"speaker": "Stefan Wintermeyer",
		"description": "Snappiness is an important key for any successful webpage. Most companies try to achieve responsive webshops by scaling their hardware big time. But Rails in combination with Nginx, Memcached and Redis is the key to deliver webpages very fast with a minimal amount of hardware. This talk will start with the basics of DHH's russian doll idea but will raise the bar than quite a bit. How can we combine fragment caching, page caching and HTTP caching to deliver personalized webshop pages for logged in users? How much brain can be delegated to Redis or the Webbrowser? Harddrive space is cheap. So use it! You'll get to know how to plan your data structure and where to use Memcached vs. Redis. Include the cache in the beginning of your development and not in the end. To make things a bit more interesting everything is replayed on a Raspberry Pi to show how much difference intelligent caching can make on any hardware. Save big time and get more clients with a faster web application!"

		"description": "Long-running branches are painful, but upgrading to Rails 3 requires one if you can't stop development, right? Wrong! At New Relic, we worked on upgrading to Rails 3 on master while letting development continue in Rails 2. We patched Bundler, built a backwards-compatible boot sequence, and punched ActiveScaffold in the face. Other developers, meanwhile, released 1400 commits worth of work without noticing any changes. We’ll talk about what we did, why we did it, and why we think this approach can help developers get over the hurdle into the Rails 3 promised land."

		"title": "Configuration Management Patterns",
		"speaker": "Beau Harrington",
		"description": "As your simple Rails app grows into a larger system or set of systems, using simple constants and Yaml files for configuration may no longer suffice.  The meaning of 'configuration' expands to include business logic alongside the customary hostnames and timeout intervals; the rate at which configuration changes are required increases; non-engineers begin to require the ability to make configuration changes themselves; different environments require different configurations.  This presentation will examine several patterns that can be applied to handle these issues, keeping iteration team high and reducing the burden on your engineering team.  We'll create and iterate on a simple game as a case study to illustrate the value of these principles in practice, and also look at a few open source projects that integrate some of these concepts.Topics: \n * moving configuration values out of source \n * sharing configuration across multiple applications/services\n * working with sensitive configuration data (eg API keys)\n * dynamically updating configuration without deployments or restarts\n * cascading/overlaying configuration values based on environment and context\n * running experiments and A/B tests\n * change control\n * testing and multi-stage deployment of configuration changesets\n * allowing non-developers to change configuration values"

		"description": "My team and I were brought into The Company to help them take their One Big Monolithic Rails App and turn it into a a handful of smaller Rails apps that all work together… mumble mumble SOA mumble mumble.When I started looking at it, I realized that 4 or 5 apps was only just scratching the surface. Instead of 5 apps, 1 for each product with a multi-tenant database, we've decided on 1 app per client, with NO multi-tenant database.We have a few internal admin apps, then a whole slew of client apps. Each client has an admin app, a deployer app (to deploy the client admin), and n apps per client that are end-user facing.- company admin apps:\n - client admin deployer:\n - client admin:\n - end user site\n - end user site\n - end user site\n - …It's the classic Rails app story. Built in 2007 and piled onto for 6 years. Lotsa of version bumps and upgrades, but never any serious refactor. It's grown and grown. Clients have grown and grown. The technical requirements and cost of operating has grown and grown.By doing this re-architecting we've reduced:\n - the technical complexity of each app (each piece of the previous one big app)\n - the resource requirements of each app\n - the cost of operation…considerably.Oh, and we're doing all PULL (no push) and HTML with microformats as 'API output' (no JSON).Those three things (lots of little apps, pull, html) are changing everything for us.

Gems underpin almost every piece of Ruby code we write - and so, being able to craft your own gems is not only incredibly useful, it provides an avenue for code reuse and open source sharing.During this session, Pat will first discuss the ecosystem around gems and the knowledge required to write your own, plus a few tools available to assist with this, and some approaches for how to structure gems that integrate with Rails itself.The workshop will then put this knowledge into practice by building our own gems from scratch."

Creating an engine can be as simple as adding a model, or a complex as an entire content management system. Using the Asset Pipeline, even javascript and css files can be packaged and shared, making projects cleaner and more maintainable than ever before.This talk will cover how developers can create their own engines, to add new controllers/models/views, rake tasks and/or generators. It will cover how engines can interact with Rails having their own initializers and middleware. Finally, based on our experiences converting BrowserCMS and its entire module ecosystem to work as mountable engines, this talk will cover how to make engines that are designed to work together, extend each other engine’s behavior and make it easy for developers to upgrade when you release new versions."

Matt will discuss how Ruby and Rails helps WhitePages build and expose its dataset, enabling a better experience for its core constituencies - consumers and businesses. This presentation will also showcase how Ruby has helped WhitePages transform its business model from a company that simply 'publishes' data to a company that 'builds' data. Finally, Matt will discuss how the improved dataset that Ruby has helped facilitate has strengthened the value proposition behind WhitePages' API, which is the vehicle that the company’s internal developers depend on to power existing products and which external developers can also tap into to support a wide range of interesting use-cases. Ultimately, you’ll learn how you can take advantage of quick and easy access to North America’s most comprehensive set of consumer contact data to build your next big product!"

		"speaker": "Casey Rosenthal",
		"description": "What is the best data storage option for your application?  We have an abundance of conventional wisdom when it comes to building applications on top of a relational database in the Ruby world.  Building an application on top of a NoSQL database is a different story.  I will present a conceptual framework for understanding Access Patterns that jives with properties of databases, then review common NoSQL databases and propose considerations for choosing one over another. I will also review some uncommon NoSQL databases that address common use cases, and suggest that perhaps some of these should be used more often. Most importantly, I will describe the different state of mind that you should have when building applications on top of these NoSQL options, and provide visualization of non-relational concerns like: fault tolerance, availability, consistency, capacity planning, and horizontal vs vertical scaling.  Whether or not you choose a NoSQL option for a future project, you won’t look at data storage options in the same way after this presentation. ;-)"

It is true Datomic fits well to Clojure programming. However, it is not only for Clojure people.\n Absolutely, Rubyists can use it. We have Diametric gem (https://github.com/relevance/diametric). Using Diametric, we can dive into Datomic from Ruby, from Rails.On Diametric, Datomic's entity is an ActiveModel compliant. Diametric supports Rails' scaffolding. Its usage might look like Datamapper or MongoDB.  Eventually, Diametric’s API design settled in a bit far from Ruby, Rails style. In another word, it is not ORM-like. Even though the API design may puzzle Rubyists, Diametric chose the one to expose Datomic's intrinsic properties. It is to leverage a good side of Datomic for us. I believe the more Rubyists use Diametric, the more they like it.In my talk, I’ll introduce Diametric gem and how to use it as well as why its API design is good for us. Also, I will cover how Ruby helped to integrate Datomic API in Diametric gem."

Lets talk about putting documentation and testing into their proper place. Tools that ease maintenance, help other developers join a project, and reduce bugs.I'm going to go over lessons learned in writing, maintaining, and introducing new developers to 20,000 lines of code.

With so many moving parts, how do you keep your service, documentation and clients in sync?We all know how to describe data using ActiveRecord models. Have you considered using a model to describe your service?A service model provides a number of benefits including: easy to generate API documentation, consistent server side parameter validation, versioned APIs, easy to build clients, and more. It also represents a unified view of your API which helps to keep your code and documentation DRY. But what does a service model look like? For instance, did you know that your APIs can be described using just four parameter types? What if your could express your APIs using a Rails DSL?This talk will introduce Seahorse, a DSL for describing API operations for just about any web service. It provides all of the above functionality, allowing you to describe your service model in a single place with Ruby code. We will demonstrate how to use Seahorse to generate clients, model existing real-world APIs, and even build one of our own."

		"description": "APIs are interfaces, just like UIs. But while a website or a mobile app is designed to be used by a consumer, an API has two very specific audiences in mind: other systems, and the programmers who build them. A well-designed API can make or break an application. So how do developers build great APIs? What design principles should be followed? We will discuss these questions based on the work of thinkers in the areas of industrial design, writing, and product design theory."

Some of us Rails developers don't have the luxury to work in a truly open environment where one can 'gem install rspec' and viola! we have testing.  So what do we do about that?  How do we use RVM to manage our gemsets and Ruby versions behind these restrictions?  What about deployments?  Is Capistrano even a viable option?  I've been on a successful Rails project for two years that's had to tackle these kinds of questions.  In this talk, I'll discuss my solutions to these problems so your project can be effective and efficient without any sacrifices.  I'll discuss how to install and manage RVM in firewalled environments, use Capistrano for remote deployments, how to test your email notifications when your SMTP server is locked down, how to use Git when no Git hosting is available, and plenty of other topics."

		"description": "Paul Graham once quipped that 'Web 2.0' really meant 'JavaScript now works'. Nearly ten years later, more and more functionality of our web applications is written in JavaScript. But for those of us who came of age when JavaScript was unreliable, it's been preferable to test the server-side, while leaving the UI a thin-as-possible shell. Testing the front-end was error prone and brittle.However, when you're delivering a JavaScript widget hundreds of thousands of times a day on diverse third party websites, it needs to work. So: we need to test it, and those tests need to be as painless as possible to write and maintain.This is a session for front-end testing skeptics (like me): It is possible to create tests that drive your web UI (JavaScript and all) that are automated, fast, reliable, headless -- no browser required -- and written in pure Ruby instead of some obtuse syntax. We'll explore the challenges and gotchas of testing the front-end and walk through an example that meets the above goals."

Two years later Shopify launched to the public on a single webserver using Rails 0.13.1. Today Shopify powers over 40k online stores and processes up to half a million product sales per day across the platform. Over 30 people actively work on Shopify which makes it the longest developed and likely largest Rails code base out there.This is the story of how Shopify has evolved to handle its immense growth over the years. This is what getting big is all about: evolving to meet the needs of your customers. You don't start out with a system and infrastructure that can handle a billion dollar in GMV. You evolve to it. You evolve by adding caching layers, hardware, queuing systems and splitting your application to services.This is the story of how we have tackled the various scaling pain points that Shopify has hit and what we have done to surpass them, what we are doing to go even further."

Allow your internal or external API consumers to eager-load model associations, request custom scopes and sorts, load multiple objects by ID simultaneously, and generate JSON that uses references instead of repeating data.While your Brainstem API can be consumed by any JSON client, it will truly shine when using the included Backbone integration, adding relationship-aware models, centralized data loading, and a smart caching identity map to your Backbone applications.All of this is designed to reduce network requests and simplify development of HTML5 applications, especially mobile ones. With Backbone + Brainstem, loading a hierarchy of objects from your server can be reduced to one line of code and one network request.This talk will survey Brainstem usage in Rails, then dive into how it can enable rich mobile HTML5 applications."

Being brought into or having to maintain a project with poorly-crafted templates leads to extreme frustration and less than-adequite-velocity. At philosophie, we have started to use a few simple patterns that result in templates that are easier to maintain. By investing a small amount of time up-front learning and applying these patterns we have saved countless hours in the long run.Topics include:\n * The Decorator Pattern\n * Using View objects\n * Sanely building forms\n * And more!"

		"speaker": "Dave Kapp",
		"description": "Sometimes, your application has to do something that is slow. Maybe you need to do some serious data crunching, maybe you need to call a slow third-party API, maybe you need to run a bunch of external processes. Trying to do these from within Rails is just asking for performance problems, as you'll be dragging your response times down significantly. But by using asynchronous workers, you can offload the work and let Rails stay nice and responsive.There are a lot of choices and architectural concerns that come in whenever you're adding another piece to your application, and we'll address those decisions along with the actual code you'll need. We'll start with an overview of what exactly an asynchronous worker is (and how it's different from some similar things), what some of the different worker queues available are, and how you can maximize code reuse within your workers. Of course, we'll also take a look at code samples that will illustrate how simple things can be once you have all the pieces talking to each other correctly.Examples will be given using Resque, an open-source asynchronous worker queue that uses Redis as the storage backend, but the ideas and patterns discussed will be applicable to other worker queues."

From spell checking in your SMS client to programmatically evaluating what your Twitter followers think of you, there is no shortage of real-world text processing and linguistic analysis problems all around us waiting to be solved. As Rubyists and software engineers, its important for us to know what tools related to NLP are available to us and how we can make use of them most effectively.\n While there are a number of really great open-source libraries for natural language processing in Ruby and many great strides have been made in recent years, there’s still often a need to leverage tools and libraries externally from the Ruby ecosystem. Some of the best open-source NLP frameworks available rely very heavily on contributions from the academic world where Ruby as a language doesn’t have the same presence as other languages like Python or Java.In this talk, I’ll provide a beginner friendly introduction to NLP in general and I’ll give a quick overview of the tools and related projects that are currently available in the Ruby community. In addition, using real-world examples I’ll demonstrate how to painlessly leverage high performance, mature and well-established NLP libraries directly from your Ruby application using JRuby and JDK 7."

Why do people 'believe in TDD but I don't have time to write tests during crunch?'  How is it that we have an entire industry based around rescuing teams from acutely awful Rails apps? It's because on the job experience is a poor teacher; plateauing as soon as the developer is able to ship code that meets requirements. Schools teach Computer Science which is only tangentially related to being a developer and most kata's are approached incorrectly, giving no value at best, and reinforcing poor practices at worst. On top of all this, our pairs (for the lucky ones who pair program) probably have not shown us anything new in months.This presentation will give specific, concrete steps on how to slowly and steadily improve our game through practice and hard work. I'll identify what skill Rails developers should be focusing on and walk the audience through how to target and eliminate these weaknesses so that nothing but white hot joy streams out of our fingers and into our apps.

		"description": "The dreams of developers working on monolithic Rails applications are frequently filled with sugar plums and service-oriented architectures--but like any kind of software design, SOA can easily become a tangled mess. Many of the same principles that guide our software design can guide our architecture design. We apply SOLID principles to applications to keep them loosely coupled, we design interfaces so we can send logical messages to our domain objects. We hide our databases behind abstractions because how we access our data shouldn't matter to how we consume it. Rarely, though, do we see the same practices applied to our services and APIs, leaving us with tightly coupled and difficult to extend service-oriented architectures. If you are facing the monorail to SOA challenge, consider looking at your services as objects and your APIs as messages. Service-oriented applications are complex, and the best way to fend off complexity is though object-oriented design."

Only the Ruby and Rails core teams have meaningful experience with vulnerabilites so far. It won’t last. Vulnerabilities are everywhere, and handling security issues responsibly is critical if we want Ruby (and Rubyists) to stay in high demand. Using Bundler’s first CVE as a case study, I’ll discuss responsible disclosure, as well as repsonsible ownership of your own code. How do you know if a bug is a security issue, and how do you report it without tipping off someone malicious? As a Rubyist, you probably have at least one library of your own. How do you handle security issues, and fix them without compromising apps running on the old code? Don’t let your site get hacked, or worse yet, let your project allow someone else’s site to get hacked! Learn from the hard-won wisdom of the security community so that we won’t repeat the mistakes of others."

If you go overboard in the beginning, you're doing extra work and getting some of it wrong. If you wait too long, you've got a mess.At Yammer, we constantly clean up the mess that worked well in the early days, but has become troublesome to maintain and scale. We pull things out of the core Rails app, stand them up on their own, and make sure they work well and are fast.  With 20+ services, we've learned some lessons along the way. Services that seem clean in the beginning can turn into development environment nightmares. Temporary double-dispatching solutions turn into developer confusion. Monitoring one app turns into monitoring a suite of apps and handling failure between them.This talk looks at our mistakes and solutions, the tradeoffs, and how we're able to keep moving quickly.  Having services and a smaller Rails codebase makes for scalable development teams, happier engineers, and predictable production environments.
